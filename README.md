# Data Science Internship Project

Hello Everyone!  

This repository contains the **Employment Management System** project that I developed during my **Data Science Internship** at LearnBay. Throughout this internship, I worked extensively on building and managing a relational database system for employee data, including everything from database creation to query optimization and reporting.

## Highlights
- **Database Design & Creation**: Designed and implemented a relational database to store and manage employee-related data, including employee details, performance records, salaries, and more.
- **SQL Queries**: Developed complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from employee data, such as performance trends, salary distributions, and employee retention rates.
- **Data Normalization**: Ensured that the database adhered to normalization principles, optimizing data storage and reducing redundancy.
- **Stored Procedures & Functions**: Created stored procedures and user-defined functions to automate and streamline database operations.
- **Reporting & Analysis**: Generated detailed reports using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) and custom SQL queries for HR and management teams.

## About the Repository
This repository serves as a showcase of my work during the internship, where I:
- Designed the database schema for the Employment Management System.
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze employee data and provide actionable insights.
- Implemented stored procedures to automate common tasks like salary updates, performance reviews, and employee status changes.
- Created reports to visualize employee performance and HR metrics.

The project demonstrates how **MSSQL** can be used to manage and analyze employee data, providing HR teams with tools to make informed, data-driven decisions.
